# Rock vs. Mine Prediction Project Repository_hmx
Welcome to the "Rock vs. Mine Prediction" project repository! This project focuses on leveraging machine learning to predict whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine based on a provided dataset in CSV format.
Contents

# Dataset:
I provide a CSV dataset containing data related to underwater objects, specifically indicating whether each object is a rock or a mine. This dataset serves as a crucial resource for training and evaluating machine learning models.<br><br>
# Jupyter Notebook:
The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook file named "Copy of Sonar data.ipynb." Within this notebook, we perform the following key tasks:<br>
**Data Exploration:** <br>
Delve into the dataset to comprehend its structure, feature distribution, and conduct initial data analysis.<br>
**Data Preprocessing:** <br>
Preprocess the data, addressing issues such as handling missing values, cleaning textual information, and performing necessary feature engineering.<br>
**Machine Learning Models:** <br>
Implement machine learning models to predict whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine. This involves tasks such as data splitting, model training, and comprehensive model evaluation.<br>
**Results and Insights:** <br>
Present the results and insights derived from the analysis, showcasing the performance of the developed machine learning models.<br><br>
# Requirements:
To run the Jupyter Notebook and replicate the analysis, please refer to the requirements outlined in the README file. It is recommended to set up a Python environment with the necessary libraries to facilitate a smooth start.
