# Rock vs. Mine Prediction Project Repository_hmx
Welcome to the "Rock vs. Mine Prediction" project repository! This project focuses on leveraging machine learning to predict whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine based on a provided dataset in CSV format.
Contents

# Dataset:
I provide a CSV dataset containing data related to underwater objects, specifically indicating whether each object is a rock or a mine. This dataset serves as a crucial resource for training and evaluating machine learning models.
# Jupyter Notebook:
The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook file named "Copy of Sonar data.ipynb." Within this notebook, we perform the following key tasks:
**Data Exploration:**
Delve into the dataset to comprehend its structure, feature distribution, and conduct initial data analysis.
**Data Preprocessing:**
Preprocess the data, addressing issues such as handling missing values, cleaning textual information, and performing necessary feature engineering.
**Machine Learning Models:**
Implement machine learning models to predict whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine. This involves tasks such as data splitting, model training, and comprehensive model evaluation.
**Results and Insights:**
Present the results and insights derived from the analysis, showcasing the performance of the developed machine learning models.
# Requirements:
To run the Jupyter Notebook and replicate the analysis, please refer to the requirements outlined in the README file. It is recommended to set up a Python environment with the necessary libraries to facilitate a smooth start.
How to Use This Repository:
**Clone the Repository:**
Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the provided Git clone command.
**Review the Dataset:**
Familiarize yourself with the dataset provided in the "data" directory. Understand the features and the target variable (rock vs. mine) for effective model training.
**Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
Execute the Jupyter Notebook "Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb" to step through the data exploration, preprocessing, model implementation, and results analysis.
